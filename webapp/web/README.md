# Sharknado RecSys Webapp

Here's what I imagine:

## Add new models

1. Train the model on your local machine and export the coefficients (the model) to a file.
2. Upload the model to the webapp

## Test model

1. Choose the model to you want to use (v1 or v2, etc)
2. Select a user (it will show all the items user u rated)
3. Show top 10 recommendations w/ ranking score
